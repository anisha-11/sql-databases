# SQL Databases 

Week 3 included working with databases using an application called TablePlus. This essentially allows you to store data in this database which can then be used to send queries and manipulate the data that is currently stored. It also worked through building a program which communicates with the databese, through different relationships like one-to-many or many-to-many, which has factors that can overlap quite often.
